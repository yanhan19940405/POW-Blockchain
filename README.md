# POW-Blockchain
##Demo trial preparation##
1. This demo is considered for simplicity without putting it in a test server deployment.
2. This demo explores small demos for blockchain structures and block internal structures.
3. This demo takes into account native performance issues. Currently it contains only one Genesis block and two sub-blocks. This demo can be internally extended to any number of blocks. For details, see the internal comments in the code.
4. The POW proof model passes the hash 256 encryption algorithm example with the first four zeroes. The follow-up time is sufficient. This demo will introduce variables representing the computational capabilities. Front-end data rendering from the back-end values, and then the calculation of block node selection. .
5. It is recommended to use Google Chrome. After clicking the entry file, you can see the specific hash calculation process in the browser console and finally output the specific block json data.
